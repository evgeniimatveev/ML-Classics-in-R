##  Description
This repository provides implementations of **classic machine learning algorithms** in **R**, structured into five parts. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, and association rule learning.

### Why this project?
-  **Hands-on Learning**: Practical implementation of ML algorithms in R.
-  **Well-Structured Approach**: Organized into key ML categories for easy navigation.
-  **Beginner & Advanced Friendly**: Covers fundamental and advanced ML techniques.
-  **Educational Purpose**: Inspired by the SuperDataScience ML A-Z course.
